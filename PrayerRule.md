##### Morning Prayer to the Holy Trinity

Arising from sleep, I thank You, O Most Holy Trinity, that, for the sake of Your great kindness and longsuffering, You have not had indignation against me, for I am slothful and sinful. Neither have You destroyed me in my transgressions. But You have shown Your customary love toward mankind, and have raised me up as I lay in heedlessness, that I might sing my morning hymn and glorify Your sovereignty. Do now enlighten the eyes of my understanding, open my ears to receive Your words, and teach me Your commandments. Help me to do Your will, to sing to You, to confess You from my heart, and to praise Your All-Holy Name: of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.

##### The Nicene Creed

I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible; and in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Only-Begotten, begotten of the Father before all worlds, Light of Light, Very God of Very God, begotten, not made; of one essence with the Father; by Whom all things were made; Who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered and was buried; the third day He rose again according to the Scriptures; and ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again with glory to judge the living and the dead; Whose Kingdom shall have no end. And I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord and Giver of Life, Who proceeds from the Father, Who with the Father and the Son together is worshiped and glorified, Who spoke by the prophets. And I believe in One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church. I acknowledge one Baptism for the remission of sins. I look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen.

##### Scripture Reading

*According to your reading plan you may, as time permits, read the Psalms, Old Testament, and New Testament passages for this day, each followed by:*

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.

##### Intercessory Prayers

Remember, O Lord Jesus Christ, our God, Your mercies and lovingkindnesses, which have been from everlasting, and for the sake of which You did become man and deign to endure crucifixion and death for the salvation of all who rightly believe in You. You rose from the dead and ascended into heaven, and sit at the right hand of God the Father, and regard the humble prayers of all who call upon You with their whole heart. Incline Your ear and hear the humble entreaty of me, Your unprofitable servant, who offers it for an odor of spiritual fragrance for all Your people.

And first of all remember Your Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church which You have purchased with Your precious blood. Confirm and strengthen it, enlarge and multiply it, keep it in peace, and preserve it unconquerable by the gates of hell forever. Heal the schisms of the churches, quench the ragings of the heathen, speedily undo and root out the growths of heresies, and bring them to naught by the power of Your Holy Spirit.

Save, O Lord, and have mercy upon all world rulers, on our president *(name)*, on *(names)*, and on all our civil authorities. Speak peace and blessing in their hearts for Your holy Church and for all Your peoples, in order that we may live a calm and peaceful life, in all godliness and dignity.

Save, O Lord, and have mercy upon patriarchs, metropolitans, archbishops, priests, ministers and deacons, and the whole clergy of Your Church, which You have established to feed the flock of Your word, and by their prayers have mercy upon me, and save me, a sinner.

Save, O Lord, and have mercy upon my spiritual father *(name)* and by his holy prayers forgive me my transgressions.

Save, O Lord, and have mercy upon my parents *(names)*, my spouse *(name)*, my brothers and sisters *(names)*, my children *(names)*, my kinsmen after the flesh and my friends, and grant them Your blessings both here and hereafter.

Save, O Lord, and have mercy upon the old, the young, the needy, the orphans and the widows, and on all that are in sickness and sorrow, in distress and affliction, in oppression and captivity, in prison and confinement. More especially have mercy upon Your servants who are under persecution for Your sake and for the sake of the Orthodox faith at the hands of heathen nations, of apostates, and of heretics: remember them, visit, strengthen, keep and comfort them, and make haste to grant them, by Your power, relief, freedom and deliverance.

Save, O Lord, and have mercy upon all who are sent on duty, all who travel, our fathers, brothers and sisters, and upon all true Christians.

Save, O Lord, and have mercy upon those who envy and affront me, and do me mischief, and do not let them perish through me, a sinner.

Those who depart from the Orthodox faith, dazzled by destroying heresies, do enlighten by the light of Your holy wisdom, and unite them to Your Holy, Apostolic, Catholic Church.

##### Prayer for the Beginning of the Day

O Lord, grant me to greet the coming of the day in peace, help me in all things to rely upon Your holy will. In every hour of the day reveal Your will to me. Bless my dealings with all who surround me. Teach me to treat all that comes to me throughout the day with peace of soul and with firm conviction that Your will governs all. In all my deeds and words, guide my thoughts and feelings. In unforeseen events, let me not forget that all are sent by You. Teach me to act firmly and wisely, without embittering and embarrassing others. Give me strength to bear the fatigue of the coming day with all that it shall bring. Direct my will, teach me to pray. And, Yourself, pray in me. Amen.

He who dwells in the help of the Most High shall dwell in the shelter of the God of heaven.
He will say to the Lord: You are my protector and my refuge, my God; in Him will I hope.
For He will deliver you from the snare of hunters and from troubling words.
With His arm will He overshadow you, and beneath His wings will you hope; as a shield will His truth encompass you.
You will fear no terror by night, nor any arrow that flies by day; no creature that moves in the darkness, nor any mishap or noonday demon.
Though a thousand fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right, yet it shall not come near you.
With your eyes you will behold and see the reward of sinners.
For You, O Lord, are my hope; You made the Most High Your refuge.
No evil shall befall you, nor shall any affliction approach your habitation.
For He has commanded His angels concerning you, to guard you in all your ways.
In their hands shall they bear you up, lest you dash your foot against a stone.
You will tread upon the asp and the basilisk, and trample the lion and the dragon.
Because he hoped in Me, I shall deliver him; I will shelter him, because he knew My name.
He will cry to Me, and I shall hear him; I am with him when trouble is near.
I shall deliver him and glorify him.
With long life shall I satisfy him, and show him My salvation.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.

##### A Prayer for the Noon Hour

O God and Lord of powers, Maker of all creation, through the compassion of Your unfathomable mercy You sent down Your Only-begotten Son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, for the salvation of our race, and through His precious Cross tore up the record of our sins, and by it triumphed over the principalities and powers of darkness. Do You Yourself, O Master and Lover of mankind, accept also our supplications of thanksgiving and entreaty, and deliver us from transgressions of destruction and darkness, and from all our enemies, seen and unseen, who seek to harm us. Nail down our flesh through fear of You; let not our hearts be inclined to words or thoughts of evil, but wound our souls with longing for You, that ever gazing upon You and guided by the light that comes from You, we may behold Your unapproachable and everlasting light, and give thanks to You, the Eternal Father, with Your Only-begotten Son and Your All-holy, Good, and Life-giving Spirit, now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.

##### A Prayer for the Ninth Hour

O Master, Lord Jesus Christ our God, who have long endured our transgressions and brought us to this hour, in which, hanging on the life-giving tree, You showed the good thief the way to Paradise and destroyed death by death: have mercy also on us sinners and Your unworthy servants. For we have sinned and trespassed and are not worthy to raise our eyes and look upon the heights of heaven, because we have forsaken Your righteous ways and have followed the will of our hearts. But we implore Your unbounded goodness: spare us, O Lord, according to the greatness of Your mercy; for the sake of Your holy name, save us; for our days have been wasted in vanity. Deliver us from the hand of our enemy, forgive us our sins, and slay the will of our flesh, so that, having cast off the old man, we may put on the new and live for You, our Master and Benefactor. Thus following Your precepts may we find eternal rest, where those who rejoice abide. For You are the true joy and gladness of those who love You, O Christ our God, and to You we give glory, together with Your Eternal Father, and Your All-holy, Good, and Life-giving Spirit, now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.

##### Psalm Reading

*You may read Psalm 103 below, or another suitable Psalm*

Bless the Lord, O my soul!
O Lord my God, You have been greatly magnified.
You have clothed Yourself with thanksgiving and majesty.
You have wrapped Yourself in light as with a garment.
You have stretched out the heavens like a curtain.
You are He who covers the upper chambers with waters, who makes the clouds His mount, who walks on the wings of the wind,
who makes His angels spirits and His ministers a flame of fire, who established the earth upon its foundations; throughout the ages it shall not be moved.
The deep, like a cloak, is its mantle; waters will rest upon the mountains.
At Your rebuke shall they flee; at the voice of Your thunder shall they tremble.
The mountains rise and the plains descend to the place which You established for them.
You fixed a limit that they will not pass, nor will they return to cover the earth.
You send out springs into the valleys; waters shall run between the mountains.
They will give drink to all the beasts of the field; wild donkeys will await them to quench their thirst.
The birds of the air will nest beside them and sing among the rocks.
He waters the mountains from His upper chambers; the earth will be filled from the fruit of His works.
He makes the grass grow for the cattle and green herbs for the service of man;
to bring forth bread from the earth, and wine gladdens the heart of man;
to brighten his face with oil, and bread gives strength to the hearts of men.
The trees of the plain will be satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon, which You planted.
There the sparrows will build their nests; the house of the heron is leader among them.
The high mountains are for the deer; rocks a refuge for hares.
He made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knows the hour of its setting.
You appointed darkness, and it was night, in which all the beasts of the forest will prowl;
young lions roaring to plunder and to seek their food from God.
The sun rose and they gathered together, and they will lie down in their dens.
Man shall go out to do his work, to labor until the evening.
Greatly magnified are Your works, O Lord!
In wisdom You have made them all; the earth was filled with Your creation.
There is the great, wide sea; there are creeping things without number, living creatures both small and great.
There ships go to and fro; there is that leviathan which You have made to play therein.
All things look to You to give them their food in due season.
When You give it to them, they will gather it.
When You open Your hand, all things will be filled with goodness.
But when You turn away Your face, they will be troubled.
You will take away their spirit, and they will perish and return to the dust.
You will send forth Your Spirit, and they shall be created, and You will renew the face of the earth.
Let the glory of the Lord endure forever. The Lord will rejoice in His works.
He looks upon the earth and makes it tremble. He touches the mountains, and they smoke.
For as long as I live I will sing to the Lord; for as long as I am alive I will praise my God.
May my words be pleasing to Him. As for me, I shall rejoice in the Lord.
Oh, that sinners would perish from the earth, and that the wicked would be no more!
Bless the Lord, O my soul!

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.
